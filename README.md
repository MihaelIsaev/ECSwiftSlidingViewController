ECSlidingViewController in Swift!
============================

Translated to Swift ECSlidingViewController

Hello everyone!

I rewrote [the whole library](https://github.com/ECSlidingViewController/ECSlidingViewController) into Swift, but I think there are some mistakes because it doesn't work properly.
I don't know if the author of the library is woking on the same issue, I just want to use this library in Swift without obj-c bridging.

Any help is welcome!
