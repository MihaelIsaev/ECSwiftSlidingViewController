ECSlidingViewController in Swift!
============================

Translated to Swift ECSlidingViewController

Hello everyone!

I rewrote [the whole library](https://github.com/ECSlidingViewController/ECSlidingViewController) into Swift.
I've fixed critical bugs, but I still need help. Now the most nasty problem is not smoothly opening menu with slide gesture..

Any help is welcome!
